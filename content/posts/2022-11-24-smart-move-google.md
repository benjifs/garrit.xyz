For as long as I can remember, `maps.google.com` was the defacto domain for
Google Maps. Also for as long as I can remember, I allowed this domain to use
the location services of my browser.

Yesterday I was asked to allow the usage of location services for Google Maps
seemingly out of nowhere. Of course I accepted. After all, I just wanted to
check a route to a local business and I was in a hurry. Back home I opened
Google Maps again, and noticed that `maps.google.com` now redirects to
`google.com/maps`. This implies that the permissions I give to Google Maps now
apply to **all** of Googles services hosted under this domain. So far I only
identified Google Flights to have made the same switch (`google.com/flights`),
though I'm sure they're just beginning to transfer their services to the main
`google.com` domain.

Congratulations, you now have permission to geo-track me across **all** of your
services.

Smart move, Google.
